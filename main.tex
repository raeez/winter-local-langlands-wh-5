\begin{document}

\begin{abstract}The purpose of this talk (\Wh{5}) is two-fold: first we will set
up the context needed to attack the FLE; second, we will address material needed
for the local-to-global compatibilities to be discussed in \Ja{4}.\end{abstract}

\section{The formal setting}

  We begin by addressing the formal setting: Recall that we have introduced two
  forms of the FLE (at positive and negative levels
  respectively).\\


  We begin at the negative level\footnotemark; when we set out to prove the FLE
  we want to relate the Kazhdan-Lusztig category for $G$ and Whittaker category
  for $\Gr_{\check{G}}$ to the corresponding categories for the Torus; this
  relation takes the form of a diagram:

  \begin{tikzcd}
    \KL(G)_{\neglv} \arrow[d,"j_!^{KM,Lus}"] \arrow[r,"FLE_G" description]
     & \Whit_{\dneglv}(\Gr_{\check{G}}) \arrow[d, "j_!^{Whit,Lus}"] \\
     \KL(T)_{\neglv} \arrow[r, "\sim", "FLE_T"] & \Whit_{\dneglv}(\Gr_{\check{T}}) \\
  \end{tikzcd}

  \footnotetext{Recall that by convention
    $\kappa$ denotes positive level, hence $-\kappa$ is used for negative
  level.}

  The desired vertical functors should make the diagram commute, be factorizable
  and by applying these functors to the units on both sides we expect to obtain
  the factorization algebras constituting the subject of the last talk.
  Morevover, the factorizable algebras should match up under the bottom
  isomorphism, but it will \textbf{not} be the case that the induced map on
  factorization module categories will be an equivalence.
  % insert some discussion

  The essential thrust of the last talk will be a conjectural bootstrapping of
  an equivalence given what structure we do have apparent here.

  \begin{rmk}
    We saw in \Ja{3} the definition of the functor $j_!^{KM,Lus}$. Note the
    designation of \textit{Lus} in contrast to the existence of a more naive
    functor corresponding to the de-Concini-Kac form of the quantum group, which
    will not produce the correct diagram. %more commentary
  \end{rmk}

  % TODO check to see if Lin's notes defines both Whit and KM sides

  We still need a definition of the functor $j_!^{Whit,Lus}$. First, we'll drop
  the notation \textit{Lus}\footnotemark\footnotetext{reserving this notation
    for the factorization algebra as in $\Omega_q^{Lus}$ arising as the image of
  the unit under the functor $j_!^{KM}$} and define another functor
  $j_{!*}^{Whit}$; this new functor also
  has an incarnation on the Kac-Moody side as $j_{!*}^{KM}$, giving a diagram:

  \begin{tikzcd}
    \KL(G)_{\neglv} \arrow[transform
    canvas={xshift=1.9ex},d,"j_{!*}^{KM}"]\arrow[transform
    canvas={xshift=-1.9ex}, d,"j_!^{KM}"] \arrow[r,"FLE_G" description]
    & \Whit_{\dneglv}(\Gr_{\check{G}}) \arrow[transform
    canvas={xshift=1.9ex},d, "j_{!*}^{Whit}"]\arrow[transform
    canvas={xshift=-1.9ex}, d, "j_!^{Whit}"] \\
     \KL(T)_{\neglv} \arrow[r, "\sim", "FLE_T"] & \Whit_{\dneglv}(\Gr_{\check{T}}) \\
  \end{tikzcd}

  We can similarly express the corresponding diagram at positive level:

  \begin{tikzcd}
    \KL(G)_{\poslv} \arrow[transform
    canvas={xshift=1.9ex},d,"j_{!*}^{KM}"]\arrow[transform
    canvas={xshift=-1.9ex}, d,"j_!^{KM}"] \arrow[r,"\tilde{FLE}_G" description]
    & \Whit_{\dposlv}(\Gr_{\check{G}}) \arrow[transform
    canvas={xshift=1.9ex},d, "j_{!*}^{Whit}"]\arrow[transform
    canvas={xshift=-1.9ex}, d, "j_!^{Whit}"] \\
    \KL(T)_{\poslv} \arrow[r, "\sim", "\tilde{FLE}_T"] & \Whit_{\dposlv}(\Gr_{\check{T}}) \\
  \end{tikzcd}

  As we have seen, for the torus there is no disctinction between FLE for
  positive and negative levels (recall positivity refers to the killing form on
  simple factors.) However, on the Kac-Moody side, these functors will differ by
  a Cartan involution. In contrast, since the Whittaker category is geometric,
  it does not see the distinction between positive and negative level; the main
  features of these functors on the Whittaker side will be the same as at the
  negative level. As we saw in \Ja{3}, these functors on the Kac-Moody
  side strongly depend on the positivity or negativity of the level, while on
  the Whittaker side they do not.\\

  \begin{rmk}
    What was referred to as $j_*$ in \Ja{3} (in relation to $C_*$ semi-infinite
    cohomology) at positive level is here $j_!$.
    % TODO clarify
  \end{rmk}

  In the next section we will recall definitions of a subset of these functors
  (for the rest, and in greater detail, see \Ja{3}).

  \begin{rmk}
    We can express the plan for \Ja{4} in terms of these FLE diagrams for
    negative and positive level: to see this, note that all of these local
    categories are related to the corresponding global categories
    ($\Bun(G),\Bun(\check{G}) \Bun(T),\Bun(\check{T})$, and similarly for
    parabolics and their levi factors etc.\ ), such that there analogously
    exist functors relating these global categories. \Ja{4} will describe the
    interaction of these global categories equipped with global functors and
    their compatabilities and interactions with variants of the Eisenstein
    series and constant term functors. We will see that the structure amounts
    in the global setting to a series of commutative cubes.
  \end{rmk}

\section{Recollections on definitions of the functors $j_!$ and $j_{!*}$}
\subsection{$j_{\{!,!*\}}^{KM}$ at the positive level}
Let us begin by recalling from \Ja{3} the
semi-infinite cohomology functor

  $$C_* = C^{\semiinf}(\Lnm^+, -),$$

  in terms of which we can define $j_!^{KM}$ and $j_{!*}^{KM}$, via the following diagram:

% TODO swap to more traditional N^-(K)T(O) notation?
  \begin{tikzcd}
    j_{\{!,!*\}}^{KM} : \affgmod_{\poslv}^{\LG^+} \ar[equal, d] \arrow[r, transform
    canvas={yshift=1.9ex}, "\phi_!"] \arrow[r, transform
    canvas={yshift=-1.9ex}, "\phi_{!*}"]&
    (\affgmod_{\poslv})_{\LNm\LT^+} \arrow[r, "C_*"] &
      (\afftmod_{\poslv})_{\LT^+} \ar[equal, d] \\
    \KL(G)_{\poslv}  & & \KL(T)_{\poslv} \\
  \end{tikzcd}

Here we have used the fact that invariants and co-invariants coincide, as well
as the fact that $C_*$ is well-behaved at the positive level. Thus, at the
positive level we have reduced the definition of $j_!^{KM}$ and $j_{!*}^{KM}$ to
the specification of
$\phi_!$ and $\phi_{!*}$.

\subsection{The functors $\phi_{!}$ and $\phi_{!*}$ by convolution}
The functors $\phi_!$ and $\phi_{!*}$ map $\LG+$
invariants to $\LNm\LT^+$-coinvariants, and hence exhibit a universal nature:
both are given by convolution with an object of

  \begin{tikzcd}
    \DMod(\Gr_G)_{\LNm\LT^+} \arrow[r,"\sim"] & \DMod(\Gr_G)^{\LN\LT^+}.
  \end{tikzcd}

  The appearance of the affine grassmannian as underlying geometry for our
  $\DMod$ category corresponds to the fact that in the domain of the functors
  $\phi_{\{!,!*\}}$ we have passed to
  $\LG^+$-invariants; by the action of convolution by anything in this category,
  we can pass to $\LNm\LT^+$-coinvariants so as to land in the desired codomain.

  In order to specify the objects we will convolve against, consider the
  inclusion:

  \begin{tikzcd}
    S_{Ran}^0 \arrow[r,hookrightarrow,"j"] & \overline{S_{Ran}^0} \\
    j_!(\omega_{S_{Ran}^0}) & \IC^{\semiinf} \\
  \end{tikzcd}

  Whether over a point, or allowing the points to move over the Ran space, we
  have an inclusion of the corresponding $\DMod$ categories:


  \begin{tikzcd}
    \DMod(\Gr_G)_{\LNm\LT^+} \arrow[r,"\sim"] & \DMod(\Gr_G)^{\LN\LT^+}. \\
    & \DMod(\overline{S^0})^{\LN\LT^+} \arrow[u,hookrightarrow]\\
  \end{tikzcd}

  blah blah

  \begin{tikzcd}
    \Whit_{\poslv}^!(\Gr_G) \arrow[d,transform
    canvas={xshift=1.9ex},"j_!^{whit}"] \arrow[d,transform
    canvas={xshift=-1.9ex},"j_{!*}^{whit}"] \\  %\arrow[d,"j_!^{whit}, j_{!*}^{whit}"] \\
    \DMod(\Gr_T)
  \end{tikzcd}

  \subsection{$j_!^{whit,\lambda}$ and $j_{!*}^{whit,\lambda}$}

  \begin{tikzcd}
    S^{-,\lambda} \arrow[r,hookrightarrow,"j"] & \overline{S^{-,\lambda}} \\
    j_!(\omega_{S^{-,\lambda}}) & \IC^{\semiinf+\lambda} \\
  \end{tikzcd}

  \begin{tikzcd}
    \mathcal{F} \mapsto & \Gamma_{dR}(\Gr_G, \mathcal{F} \otimes -)
  \end{tikzcd}


\end{document}
